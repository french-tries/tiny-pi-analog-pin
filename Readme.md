# Tiny pi analog pin - CSharp driver

This project started as a way to interface an old wired vhs recorder remote to
a raspberry pi. Then it became a way to use a attiny32 to report analolg values
to the pi. Now I'm having fun coding my own serial communication protocol.

Also, this project uses only immutable classes as an experiment.

This readme will be replaced by a proper serious one one this project reach it's final form.
